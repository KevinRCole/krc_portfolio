## March 2, 2022

This is a UW Coding Bootcamp project that required me to create my own Bootcamp portfolio by buidling a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.  The website had to be responsive to varying screen widths.  I completed this project March 2, 2022.

## Description

In this project, I wrote HTLM CSS to lay out a basic structure and personal style for a responsive website to display my Bootcamp portfolio.  I used semantic HTML.  I used flex box in CSS, and media query in HTML to make the webpage responsive to varying screen widths.  I plan to improve and add content to this website as Bootcamp progresses and I complete more projects.

My motivation and reason for doing this project was to learn how to build a website and style a web using HTML and CSS, and to learn how to make the website responsive to varying screen widths.

## Credits

In writiing the HTML CSS "from scratch," I relied heavily on and borrowed pieces of code from Bootcamp projectsmaterials and other online tutorials, from places like W3School.com.
